> Create and delete databases

Default database name: ***postgres***

With the help of this command you can see all commands in SQL Shell
``` bash
\?
```
With the help of this command you can see all databases
``` bash
\l
```
**CREATE DATABASE *database.name;*** â€” command to create a database <br/>
ðŸ‘‡ command to switch to other databases 
``` bash
\c database.name
```
**DROP DATABASE *database.name;*** â€” command to delete a database <br/>
> Create tables

ðŸ‘‡ command to create tables <br/>
**CREATE TABLE *table_name(<br/>
column_name + data_type + constraints (if any) <br/>
)***

With the help of this command you can see all tables
``` bash
\d
```
With the help of this command you can see anyone table
``` bash
\d table.name
```
**NOT NULL** â€” The user must enter it.
For example:
``` bash
email VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL
```
** PRIMARY KEY ** â€” Using primary keys we can create unique columns (it is impossible to repeat the same thing);
For example: 
``` bash
id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
```
ðŸ‘† If you used ID number 1 you can't use it again.
**DROP TABLE table.name** â€” command to delete any tables.

ðŸ‘‡ command to clear the SQL shell
``` bash
\! cls
```

**INSERT INTO table.name (column_name) VALUES (values for columns)** â€” command to add users(or something) to the table. <br/>
For example:
```bash
INSERT INTO employee (first_name, last_name, gender, email, date_of_birth) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'Male', 'Jd@mail.com', '2000-01-01');
```
ðŸ‘‡ command to see number of users(or something) in the table.

``` bash
\dt employee
```
With [this site](https://mockaroo.com/) you can create a .sql file (for a table) for testing.

ðŸ‘‡ command to import downloaded .sql file.
``` bash
\i path(for exampleC:/users/downloads/sqlname.sql)
```

> Queries for fetching data

**SELECT * FROM *table.name;*** â€” command to get all users(or something) in the table. <br/>
**SELECT FROM *table.name;*** â€” command to get number of users(or something) in the table. <br/>
**SELECT *column_name* FROM *table.name;*** - command to get just one column_name rows. <br/>
For example: 
```bash
SELECT first_name FROM employee;
```
Also you can get two or more column_name rows with the help of this command ðŸ‘‡ <br/>
**SELECT *first_column_name*, *second_column_name* FROM *table.name;*** - command to get just one column_name rows. <br/>
For example: 
```bash
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employee;
```
**
SELECT * FROM *table.name* ORDER BY *column_name* ASC(or DESC);** â€” command to sort alphabetically or vice versa.
If you are using ASC â€” alphabetically;
If you are using DESC â€” vice versa;

For example: 
``` bash
SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY country_of_birth DESC;
```

**SELECT DISTINCT *column_name* FROM *table.name;*** â€” you can subtract exactly the same values once in a row; <br/>
For example:
``` bash
SELECT DISTINCT country_of_birth FROM employee ORDER BY country_of_birth DESC;
```
**SELECT * FROM *table.name* WHERE *column_name* = *'value';*** â€” you can find out which users exactly matches your request; <br/>
For example:
``` bash
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE gender = 'Female';
```
**SELECT * FROM *table.name* WHERE *first_column_name* = *'value';* AND *second_column_name* = *'value';*** â€” you can find out which users exactly matches your request; <br/>
For example:
``` bash
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE gender = 'Female' AND country_of_birth = 'Russia';
```
Also you can use this: ðŸ‘‡<br/>
For example: 
``` bash
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE gender = 'Female' AND (country_of_birth = 'Russia' OR country_of_birth = 'Ukraine');
```

**SELECT * FROM *table.name* LIMIT 20(or any number);** â€” you can get only 20 users(or something);<br/>
For example:
```bash
SELECT * FROM employee LIMIT 20;
```
Also you can use this: ðŸ‘‡<br/>
**SELECT * FROM *table.name* OFFSET 10 LIMIT 5;** â€” You can get 5 of the ID number users starting with the number 11. <br/>
Also you can use this: ðŸ‘‡<br/>
**SELECT * FROM *table.name* OFFSET 10 FETCH FIRST 5 ROW ONLY;** â€” You can get 5 of the ID number users starting with the number 11. <br/>

For example you used this: ðŸ‘‡<br/>
**SELECT * FROM employee WHERE country_of_birth = 'China' OR country_of_birth = 'Argentina' OR country_of_birth = 'Israel';** <br/>
But you can use the shorter version: ðŸ‘‡ <br/>
**SELECT * FROM employee WHERE country_of_birth IN('China', 'Argentina', 'Israel');** <br/>

**SELECT * FROM employee WHERE date_of_birth BETWEEN '2000-01-01' AND '2001-01-01'** â€” you can find users who was born between these times. <br/>
**SELECT * FROM employee WHERE email LIKE '%.com'** â€” you can find users whose email is created like this.
