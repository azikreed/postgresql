Server [localhost]: *(Press ENTER)* <br/>
Database [postgres]: *(Press ENTER or choose Database)* <br/>
Port [8000]: *(Press ENTER or enter Port)* <br/>
Username [postgres]: *(Press ENTER or enter Username)* <br/>

> Create and delete databases

Default database name: ***postgres***

With the help of this command you can see all commands in SQL Shell
``` bash
\?
```
With the help of this command you can see all databases
``` bash
\l
```
**CREATE DATABASE *database.name;*** â€” command to create a database <br/>
ðŸ‘‡ command to switch to other databases 
``` bash
\c database.name
```
**DROP DATABASE *database.name;*** â€” command to delete a database <br/>
> Create tables

ðŸ‘‡ command to create tables <br/>
**CREATE TABLE *table_name(<br/>
column_name + data_type + constraints (if any) <br/>
)***

With the help of this command you can see all tables
``` bash
\d
```
With the help of this command you can see anyone table
``` bash
\d table.name
```
**NOT NULL** â€” The user must enter it.
For example:
``` bash
email VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL
```
** PRIMARY KEY ** â€” Using primary keys we can create unique columns (it is impossible to repeat the same thing);
For example: 
``` bash
id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
```
ðŸ‘† If you used ID number 1 you can't use it again.
**DROP TABLE table.name** â€” command to delete any tables.

ðŸ‘‡ command to clear the SQL shell
``` bash
\! cls
```

**INSERT INTO table.name (column_name) VALUES (values for columns)** â€” command to add users(or something) to the table. <br/>
For example:
```bash
INSERT INTO employee (first_name, last_name, gender, email, date_of_birth) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'Male', 'Jd@mail.com', '2000-01-01');
```
ðŸ‘‡ command to see number of users(or something) in the table.

``` bash
\dt employee
```
With [this site](https://mockaroo.com/) you can create a .sql file (for a table) for testing.

ðŸ‘‡ command to import downloaded .sql file.
``` bash
\i path(for exampleC:/users/downloads/sqlname.sql)
```

> Queries for fetching data

**SELECT * FROM *table.name;*** â€” command to get all users(or something) in the table. <br/>
**SELECT FROM *table.name;*** â€” command to get number of users(or something) in the table. <br/>
**SELECT *column_name* FROM *table.name;*** - command to get just one column_name rows. <br/>
For example: 
```bash
SELECT first_name FROM employee;
```
Also you can get two or more column_name rows with the help of this command ðŸ‘‡ <br/>
**SELECT *first_column_name*, *second_column_name* FROM *table.name;*** - command to get just one column_name rows. <br/>
For example: 
```bash
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employee;
```
**
SELECT * FROM *table.name* ORDER BY *column_name* ASC(or DESC);** â€” command to sort alphabetically or vice versa.
If you are using ASC â€” alphabetically;
If you are using DESC â€” vice versa;

For example: 
``` bash
SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY country_of_birth DESC;
```

**SELECT DISTINCT *column_name* FROM *table.name;*** â€” you can subtract exactly the same values once in a row; <br/>
For example:
``` bash
SELECT DISTINCT country_of_birth FROM employee ORDER BY country_of_birth DESC;
```
**SELECT * FROM *table.name* WHERE *column_name* = *'value';*** â€” you can find out which users exactly matches your request; <br/>
For example:
``` bash
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE gender = 'Female';
```
**SELECT * FROM *table.name* WHERE *first_column_name* = *'value';* AND *second_column_name* = *'value';*** â€” you can find out which users exactly matches your request; <br/>
For example:
``` bash
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE gender = 'Female' AND country_of_birth = 'Russia';
```
Also you can use this: ðŸ‘‡<br/>
For example: 
``` bash
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE gender = 'Female' AND (country_of_birth = 'Russia' OR country_of_birth = 'Ukraine');
```

**SELECT * FROM *table.name* LIMIT 20(or any number);** â€” you can get only 20 users(or something);<br/>
For example:
```bash
SELECT * FROM employee LIMIT 20;
```
Also you can use this: ðŸ‘‡<br/>
**SELECT * FROM *table.name* OFFSET 10 LIMIT 5;** â€” You can get 5 of the ID number users starting with the number 11. <br/>
Also you can use this: ðŸ‘‡<br/>
**SELECT * FROM *table.name* OFFSET 10 FETCH FIRST 5 ROW ONLY;** â€” You can get 5 of the ID number users starting with the number 11. <br/>

For example you used this: ðŸ‘‡<br/>
**SELECT * FROM employee WHERE country_of_birth = 'China' OR country_of_birth = 'Argentina' OR country_of_birth = 'Israel';** <br/>
But you can use the shorter version: ðŸ‘‡ <br/>
**SELECT * FROM employee WHERE country_of_birth IN('China', 'Argentina', 'Israel');** <br/>

**SELECT * FROM employee WHERE date_of_birth BETWEEN '2000-01-01' AND '2001-01-01';** â€” you can find users who was born between these times. <br/>
**SELECT * FROM employee WHERE email LIKE '%.com';** â€” you can find users whose email is created like this. <br/>
**SELECT country_of_birth, COUNT(*) FROM employee GROUP BY country_of_birth;** â€” you can get column country_of_birth rows in the table and count of countries. <br/>

**SELECT COALESCE(email, 'not applicable') FROM employee;** â€” you can change empty nullable rows to 'your text'.
> Aggregates and Basic Arithmetic
```bash
SELECT MAX(price) FROM holiday;
   max
---------
 9975.41


SELECT MIN(price) FROM holiday;
  min
--------
 100.65


SELECT AVG(price) FROM holiday;
          avg
-----------------------
 4919.1838716148445336
 
 SELECT ROUND(AVG(price)) FROM holiday;
 round
 -----
 4919
```

**SELECT SUM (price) FROM holiday;** â€” you can find a total price of something. <br/>
> Working with Date and Time

**SELECT NOW();** â€” you can know present full time. <br/>

Also you can use this: ðŸ‘‡ <br/>

**SELECT NOW()::DATE;**  â€” you can know present date. <br/>

**SELECT NOW()::TIME;** â€” you can know present time. <br/>

If it is 2022-01-01 and you are using this: ðŸ‘‡ <br/>

**SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '10 YEAR';** <br/>

That will be the result: 2012-01-01 <br/>

Also you can use MONTH, WEEK or DAYS. <br/>

If it is 2022-01-01 and you are using this: ðŸ‘‡ <br/>

**SELECT NOW() + INTERVAL '10 YEAR';** <br/>

That will be the result: 2032-01-01 <br/>

Also you can use this: ðŸ‘‡ <br/>

**SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM NOW())** <br/>

That will be the result: 2022 <br/>
And you can use MONTH, DAY, WEEK or DOW(day of the week) <br/>

> Primary Keys

**ALTER TABLE employee DROP CONSTRAINT employee_pkey;** â€” command to delete PRIMARY KEY. <br/>
**DELETE FROM employee where id = 1;** â€” command to delete any column by id(or other columns). <br/>
**ALTER TABLE employee ADD PRIMARY KEY(id);** â€” command to add PRIMARY KEY. <br/>

> Limitations and checks

**ALTER TABLE employee ADD CONSTRAINT unique_email_address UNIQUE(email);** â€” command to add unique columns. <br/>

**SELECT DISTINCT *column_name* FROM *table.name;*** â€” command to see exactly one or the other column. <br/>
For example:
``` bash
SELECT DISTINCT gender FROM employee;
```

Also you can use limitations like this: ðŸ‘‡ <br/>
ALTER TABLE employee ADD CONSTRAINT gender_constraint CHECK (gender = 'Female' OR gender = 'Male'); <br/>

> UPSERT and Conflict Handling

**UPDATE table.name SET column_name = 'new column_value' WHERE id = (user id);** â€” command to update column_values. <br/>

**INSERT INTO employee (id, first_name, last_name, gender, email, date_of_birth, country_of_birth) VALUES (3, 'John', 'Doe', 'Male', 'John.Doe@gmail.com', DATE '2021-07-03', 'Brazil') ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;** â€” command to get around some conflicts(only for unique columns). <br/>

With the help of this you can do it so that when a conflict occurs, immediately update this column. ðŸ‘‡ <br/>
**INSERT INTO employee (id, first_name, last_name, gender, email, date_of_birth, country_of_birth) VALUES (3, 'John', 'Doe', 'Male', 'John.Doe@gmail.com', DATE '2021-07-03', 'Brazil') ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET email = EXCLUDED.email;** <br/>
Or you can use this: ðŸ‘‡ <br/>
**INSERT INTO employee (id, first_name, last_name, gender, email, date_of_birth, country_of_birth) VALUES (3, 'Jane', 'Doe', 'Male', 'John.Doe@gmail.com', DATE '2021-07-03', 'Brazil') ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET email = EXCLUDED.email, first_name = EXCLUDED.first_name;** <br/>

> Foreign Keys

With the help of this one column will be supported in both tables. ðŸ‘‡ <br/>
**ALTER TABLE *first_table_name* ADD *column_by_first_table* BIGINT REFERENCES *second_table_name(column_by_second_table)*;** <br/>
And this is a foreign key ðŸ‘† <br/>
